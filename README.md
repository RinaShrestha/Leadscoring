Problem Statement

X Education, an online course provider, targets industry professionals who explore their courses on the website. Leads are acquired through form submissions. Sales teams then engage through calls and emails, leading to variable conversions. The typical conversion rate is 30%. To optimize this, the company aims to identify 'Hot Leads' for focused communication and efficiency.

Business Objective

Lead X seeks a model that assigns lead scores (0-100) for effective Hot Lead identification. The CEO targets an 80% conversion rate. The model should be adaptable for future constraints, such as peak time strategies, resource optimization, and post-target approaches.
